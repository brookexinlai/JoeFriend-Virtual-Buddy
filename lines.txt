Are you an exception? Let me catch you <3
Are you a decimal? Because you're always floating inside my head.
Can you be my private variable? I want to be the only one w/ access to you.
Give me your I.P.
I'm a Buffered Reader. You input meaning into my life.
I'm a Boolean method whose love for you will always return true.
I think you're my compiler. My life wouldn't start without you.
If I were a method, you must be my parameter, because I'll always need you.
I got class, but I will never treat you like an object.
If you were a part of my domain, we could share cookies <3
